## **SkiingSingapore**

Decided to do this using **Javascript** but with the help of **Typescript**. I just realized it was a bit overkill to use Typescript but I already started using it so I did Typescript all the way.

File loading is done via the fs module of **NodeJS**.
I used NodeJS 9.4.0.
The main file is *index.ts*. 
Running *npm start* in the project folder will execute the app :)
